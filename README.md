Photon-statistic Retrieval vIa SPAD arrays Modelling

### 

### Note 
* SPAD measuring matrix comprising a finite number of detectors ($D$), SPAD efficiency ($\eta$), and dark-count rate ($k$) is retrieved in a novel recursive approach. Similar works:

* Cross-talk is modeled as in Afek et al., "Quantum state measurements using multipixel photon detectors" [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.79.043830](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.79.043830).
* The EME algorithm is a slightly modified version of the code given in Hlousek et al., "Accurate detection of arbitrary photon statistics" [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.153604](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.153604).
